Make Circular Images with a Border Radius
In addition to pixels, you can also specify a border-radius using a percentage.
Give your cat photo a border-radius of 50%.


You may have already noticed this, but all HTML elements are essentially little rectangles.
Three important properties control the space that surrounds each HTML element: padding, margin, and border.
An element's padding controls the amount of space between the element and its border.

An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.

Instead of specifying an element's padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left properties, you can specify them all in one line, like this:
padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;

So we've proven that id declarations override class declarations, regardless of where they are declared in your style element CSS.
Yay! We just proved that in-line styles will override all the CSS declarations in your style element.

Now that we're using Bootstrap, we can center our heading element to make it look better. All we need to do is add the class text-center to our h2 element.


To check if object property exists
map["someKey"] == undefined
